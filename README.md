# Movies-ETL

## Overview 
  * This project focused on the ETL process in data analysis. Techniques learned in this process were lambda functions, regular expressions, and sqlalchemy. Data from wikipedia and kaggle were cleaned and combined to produce a data table. Movies and their ratings can now be seen in one table.
